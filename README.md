# Crowdfunding_ETL

My partner was Audrey Fermanich and our code is slightly different from eachothers. Audrey's uses the pandas method for contacts whereas mine uses regex.

The ETL_Mini_Project_DLee.ipynb file is a Jupyter Notebook file that reads in the xlsx files in the Resources file, then splits them out to export the campaign, category, contacts, and subcategory csv.

The crowdfunding_db_schema.sql file is a SQL query used to create the Postgres db tables and defines their relationships with crowdfunding_db_schema-export.png providing a visual representation of these tables.

The crowdfunding_db_queries.sql file has base select queries for each table to prove the data is populated. Results were limited to 10 rows for efficiency's sake.
